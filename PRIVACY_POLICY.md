# BPSR Info Bot - Privacy Policy

## Effective Date: November 16, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how BPSR Info Bot collects, uses, stores, and protects information when you use our Discord bot services.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Server and Channel Information

The Bot collects and stores the following non-personal data to provide its services:

- Discord Server IDs (Guild IDs): Used to identify which servers have the Bot installed
- Discord Channel IDs: Used to determine where to send notifications and reminders
- Discord Role IDs: Used for role mentions in notifications when configured by server administrators

### 1.2 User Configuration Data

When users configure reminders and notifications, we store:

- Boss reminder preferences (selected bosses, HP thresholds)
- Event reminder subscriptions (event IDs, notification channels)
- Custom reminder descriptions (optional text provided by users)
- Timestamp data for managing notification schedules

### 1.3 Information We Do NOT Collect

The Bot does not collect, store, or process:

- User messages or message content
- Personal identifying information
- IP addresses or device information
- User activity or behavior data
- Any data outside of the Bot's specific functionality

## 2. How We Use Information

Information collected by the Bot is used exclusively for the following purposes:

- Delivering real-time boss spawn notifications to configured channels
- Sending low HP alerts for tracked bosses
- Providing in-game event reminders at scheduled times
- Responding to slash commands with boss information
- Managing and executing user-configured reminder preferences

We do not use collected data for marketing, advertising, profiling, or any purpose beyond the Bot's core functionality.

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

### 3.1 Storage Methods

All data is stored locally in SQLite databases on the Bot's hosting infrastructure.

### 3.2 Data Retention

- Active reminder configurations are retained as long as they remain configured by server administrators
- Reminder cache data is automatically purged after one hour
- When a reminder is deleted or the Bot is removed from a server, associated data is deleted
- No historical logs or archives of notifications are maintained

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

### 4.1 Third-Party Services

The Bot interfaces with the following external services to retrieve public game information:

- BPTimer API: For boss spawn times and HP data
- Game event APIs: For in-game event schedules

These services do not receive any Discord-specific data from the Bot. The Bot only retrieves publicly available game information.

### 4.2 No Data Selling or Sharing

We do not:

- Sell user data to third parties
- Share data with advertisers or marketers
- Provide data to analytics services
- Transfer data except as required by law

## 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect stored data:

- Data is stored on secure hosting infrastructure
- Access to databases is restricted to authorized systems only
- Regular updates and security patches are applied
- No sensitive or personal information is collected that would require encryption

However, no method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. User Rights and Data Control

### 6.1 Server Administrator Rights

Server administrators have full control over the Bot's data within their servers:

- Configure and modify reminders using Bot commands
- Delete reminders using the `/remove-reminder` command
- Remove all server data by removing the Bot from the server

### 6.2 Data Deletion

To request deletion of data:

- Server administrators can use the `/remove-reminder` command to delete specific reminders
- Removing the Bot from a server triggers automatic deletion of that server's reminder configurations
- For complete data deletion requests, contact us using the information provided below

The Bot may provide information or references to third-party websites, services, or APIs (such as BPTimer). We are not responsible for:
